## ‚ú® Core Features

This application helps users manage their work and break times using the Pomodoro Technique, with some unique twists:

    * **Stopwatch Mode**: Count up to track how long a task takes.
    * **Countdown Mode**: Set a specific duration for a focused work session.
* **Custom Tomato Timers**: Instantly set the countdown timer by selecting one of three predefined focus sessions:
    * **Crushed Tomato**: A quick 5-minute burst of focus.
    * **Half Tomato**: A 12-minute session for medium tasks.
    * **Whole Tomato**: The classic 25-minute Pomodoro session.
* **Session Logging**: Easily log the number of completed sessions for each tomato type using intuitive `+` and `-` buttons.
* **Local Data Storage**: (Coming Soon!) Save your session history directly on your device.
* **Productivity Statistics**: (Coming Soon!) Visualize your hard work with a beautiful charts page, allowing you to see your progress by day, week, month, or year.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a clean and organized structure to make development and maintenance easier. All the core application code is located in the `lib/` directory.

```

pomodoro\_app/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart         \# The entry point of the application.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ home\_screen.dart \# The main screen with the timer and counters.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/          \# (Optional) For reusable UI components.

```

* **`main.dart`**: Initializes the app and sets up the main theme and initial route.
