## Project layout

```
lib/
  main.dart                     # App entry, global ambient background
  models/
    pomodoro_record.dart        # Hive model (date, crushed, half, whole)
  screens/
    home_screen.dart            # Timer, counters, save session
    stats_screen.dart           # Charts, summaries, history management
  utils/
    perf.dart                   # Perf mode toggle (persisted)
    stats_utils.dart            # Aggregations, labels, comparisons
  widgets/

```

## Data & privacy

- All data is stored locally in a Hive box named `pomodoro_box`.
- No network calls are made; your data stays on-device.

## Tips

- Tap a tomato row (Crushed/Half/Whole) to quickly set the countdown.
- Use +/- to adjust counts, then Save Session.
- In Statistics, switch ranges with chips; hover/tap bars for details (where supported).
- Use the speed icon to toggle Performance Mode if your device stutters.

## Troubleshooting

- ‚ÄúAdapter not found‚Äù after changing models:

```powershell
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

- Desktop targets not available: ensure Flutter desktop is enabled and you‚Äôre on a supported OS.
- If builds seem stale, try a clean:

```powershell
flutter clean; flutter pub get
```
